# RaspberryPiProject
This was a group project that was completed throughout my Fall 2019 semester at Georgia State University in Computer Organization and Programming. It consisted of 5 assignments that gave us an understanding of the ARM assembly language; soft skills, such as using Github and having to collectively work on a coding assignment; and basics of parallel programming. All of these topics were explored through the use of a shared Raspberry Pi 3. 

All code can be found on Github via the links at the beginning of the appendix in each report.
